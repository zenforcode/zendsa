Game Rules:

    A pile contains 7 stones.

    Two players take turns.

    On a turn, a player must remove 1, 2, or 3 stones.

    The player who removes the last stone wins.

    The AI always goes first.

Your Task:

Write a function that determines the best number of stones the AI should remove on its first move to guarantee a win, assuming the opponent plays optimally.

Your function should:

    Take the current number of stones as input.

    Return the number of stones to remove (1, 2, or 3) on the AI's first move.

    Consider all possible future moves for both players.

Bonus:

Optimize your solution to avoid redundant calculations as the number of stones increases.
