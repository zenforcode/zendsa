# Find duplicate number
Given an array of positive numbers, nums, such that the values lie in the range [1,n][1,n], inclusive, 
and that there are n+1n+1 numbers in the array, find and return the duplicate number present in nums. 
There is only one repeated number in nums, but it may appear more than once in the array.
