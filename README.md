# 💡 ZenDSA

**ZenDSA** is your minimalist yet powerful guide to mastering **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. It focuses on clear, pattern-based explanations and well-organized algorithm lectures to help you build strong foundations and ace coding interviews with ease.

## 📚 What's Inside?

ZenDSA is structured around clarity and consistency, covering:

### 🔁 Pattern-Based Learning

Instead of learning each problem from scratch, we focus on **reusable problem-solving patterns**, such as:

- Sliding Window  
- Two Pointers  
- Fast & Slow Pointers  
- Merge Intervals  
- Cyclic Sort  
- Top K Elements  
- Backtracking & Recursion Patterns  
- Dynamic Programming Templates  

### 🧱 Core Data Structures

Comprehensive breakdowns and visualizations of the most important data structures:

- **Arrays & Strings**
- **Stacks**: Usage in parsing, backtracking, expression evaluation
- **Queues & Deques**
- **Heaps / Priority Queues**: Min-heap, max-heap, and custom comparators
- **HashMaps & Sets**
- **Linked Lists**: Singly, doubly, and circular
- **Binary Trees & Binary Search Trees (BSTs)**: Traversals, insert/delete, balancing
- **Graphs**: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra’s, Topological Sort, Union-Find

### 📘 Algorithm Lectures

Each lecture is:
- Easy to follow  
- Concept-first, code-second  
- Accompanied by step-by-step examples  
- Includes edge cases + time/space complexity
